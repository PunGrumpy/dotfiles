# Vercel Design Guidelines

Review web interfaces against Vercel's comprehensive design guidelines and propose fixes.

## How It Works

1. Read the user's code (components, CSS, HTML)
2. Check against Vercel design guidelines (interactions, animations, layout, content, forms, performance, design, copywriting)
3. Report violations with specific line references
4. Propose concrete fixes with code examples

## Usage

When a user asks to review their UI or check against design guidelines:

1. Fetch the live guidelines from `https://vercel.com/design/guidelines`
2. Read the relevant source files (components, styles, HTML)
3. Analyze the code against each applicable guideline category
4. Report findings grouped by category with severity

**Guidelines URL:** https://vercel.com/design/guidelines

Always fetch fresh guidelines to ensure you're checking against the latest standards.

## Audit Categories

- **Interactions**: Keyboard accessibility, focus management, hit targets, loading states, URL persistence
- **Animations**: Reduced motion, GPU acceleration, easing, interruptibility
- **Layout**: Optical adjustment, alignment, responsive testing, safe areas
- **Content**: Inline help, skeletons, empty states, typography, accessibility
- **Forms**: Labels, validation, autocomplete, error handling, submit behavior
- **Performance**: Re-renders, layout thrashing, virtualization, preloading
- **Design**: Shadows, borders, radii, contrast, color accessibility
- **Copywriting**: Active voice, title case, clarity, error messaging

- **Warning**: UX issues, performance concerns
- **Suggestion**: Polish, best practices

## Example Review

```

## Interactions Issues

### Critical: Keyboard Accessibility

**File:** `components/Modal.tsx:28`
**Issue:** Modal lacks focus trap - keyboard users can tab outside
**Guideline:** Implement focus traps per WAI-ARIA patterns
**Fix:**

```tsx
// Add focus trap using @radix-ui/react-focus-guards or similar
import { FocusScope } from '@radix-ui/react-focus-scope'
;<FocusScope trapped>
  <ModalContent>{children}</ModalContent>
</FocusScope>
```

### Warning: Loading State Duration

**File:** `components/Button.tsx:15`
**Issue:** No minimum loading duration - causes flicker on fast responses
**Guideline:** Add 150-300ms delay and 300-500ms minimum visibility
**Fix:**

```tsx
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
const minimumLoadingTime = 300

async function handleClick() {
  setIsLoading(true)
  const start = Date.now()
  await action()
  const elapsed = Date.now() - start
  if (elapsed < minimumLoadingTime) {
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, minimumLoadingTime - elapsed))
  }
  setIsLoading(false)
}
```

```

## Quick Checklist

For rapid reviews, check these high-impact items first:

- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] Visible focus rings on focusable elements

- [ ] Form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Loading states don't flicker
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` respected
- [ ] No `transition: all`
- [ ] Errors show how to fix, not just what's wrong
- [ ] Color contrast meets APCA standards
- [ ] No zoom disabled
